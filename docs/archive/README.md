# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical versions of project documentation to preserve the evolution of development standards and practices.

## Version History

### Version 1 - Portfolio Phase (2025-01-13)
- **CLAUDE-v1-portfolio-phase.md**: Original project documentation for Darren Arney's portfolio website
  - Included project-specific implementation details
  - Laboratory automation demo specifications
  - Initial Vue.js 3 + TypeScript standards
  - Element Plus integration guidelines

- **claude-code-practices-v1.md**: Initial coding practices and standards
  - Vue component patterns
  - CSS/styling guidelines
  - Demo component layout standards
  - Touch and drag-drop best practices

### Transition Rationale
After completing the portfolio implementation phase, the documentation was refactored to:
1. Separate universal standards from project-specific details
2. Create reusable templates for future Vue.js projects
3. Establish a systematic audit workflow
4. Improve maintainability with modular documentation

### Current Documentation Structure
- `CLAUDE.md` - Universal Vue.js/TypeScript development template
- `PROJECT.md` - Current project-specific details and status
- `STANDARDS.md` - Comprehensive development standards and best practices
